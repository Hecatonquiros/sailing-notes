This isn’t the first blog in the world, and it’s not trying to be.  
Sailing Notes is simply my corner of the internet — in the spirit of the early 2000s: personal, raw, and free of clutter.  

It starts empty, but the goal is to let it fill over time with projects, thoughts, wins, and failures.

## Why Sailing Notes Exists

I’m not here to be a guru or an authority.  
This blog exists because I wanted a space of my own — a side project where I can build, experiment, and think out loud.  

I’m a mathematician and a computer scientist. For me, freedom looks like tinkering with small prototypes: quick ideas, experiments, things you can dig into until you either drop them or they click. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t — either way, I enjoy the process.  

If something feels right, I keep going. If not, I stop and move on. No guilt, no drama, no regret. Just the next step. **The journey.**

## Philosophy

I still believe there’s value in something human: an authentic voice, imperfection included.  
That’s what I want Sailing Notes to stand for — a small refuge for the genuine.  

A few commitments up front:

- **No ads, ever.**  
- No banners, pop-ups, or dark patterns.  
- Just clean, direct, personal writing.  

The design may change over time, but the focus will stay the same: **content first, never monetization.**

## What You’ll Find Here

There’s no fixed roadmap or publishing schedule.  
I’ll write about whatever feels worth putting down:  

- Programming and building micro-SaaS projects.  
- Experiments and reflections on quantitative trading.  
- Random notes: from a math theorem I find beautiful to how I organize my socks.  

Think of it as a buffet: not everything will be for everyone. Take what resonates, skip what doesn’t.  
No pressure to keep up, no FOMO, no obsession with being “super productive.”

## My Non-Negotiables

It could be 10, or 7, or 20… but here it’s **6**.  
Life isn’t perfect — embrace it.  

1. **No ads**: never banners, affiliates, or sneaky sponsorships.  
2. **Original writing**: always in my own voice.  
3. **Minimalism**: clean design, no clutter.  
4. **Consistency over perfection**: better to publish than to hoard drafts.  
5. **Document everything**: the wins and the failures alike.  
6. **Independence**: this blog is mine, not Medium’s, not Substack’s.

## Beyond the Blog

Sailing Notes also reflects the pillars I live by.  
Without them, nothing else would make sense:  

- Maximize days of joy, minimize the ones of pure obligation.  
- Keep evolving, keep doing.  
- Care for the basics: sleep, nutrition, exercise, and mind.  
- Loyalty and respect as the foundation of any relationship.  
- Gratitude and integrity as daily practices.  
- Stay analytical: objective, critical, and curious.

## Welcome Aboard

I don’t know how long this journey will last — a week, a year, or a lifetime.  
What I do know is that I want to enjoy it while I build, write, and share.  

If you’d like to come along, welcome aboard.  
I hope the deck stays open and the wind fair enough that you’ll want to return.
