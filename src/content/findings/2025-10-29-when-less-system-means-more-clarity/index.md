I've spent months refining my system: Obsidian for ideas, GTD for tasks,  
calendars, reminders, and workflows split between work, projects, and personal life.  

Today I realized that maybe simplicity isn't about connecting everything,  
but about bringing it all into one place.  

Each layer I add gives me control, but also distance.  
When everything lives in the same space—a single source of truth—  
the mind stops thinking about "where does this go"  
and returns to thinking about what I want to do.  

The fewer systems I have, the more present I am.  
And that, paradoxically, organizes everything.
