Building an app from scratch with new tech isn't hard, it's dense.  
Speed doesn't come from motivation, but from bridging what you know and what you're learning.

Every language or framework has its own mental grammar.  
Until you internalize it, everything feels slow.  
But once the pieces click, momentum builds on its own.

It's not about doing lessâ€”it's about structuring your ambition.  
Foundation first, speed second.
